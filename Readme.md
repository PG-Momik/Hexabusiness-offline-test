# Overall Review
Pretty solid test. Could have done better. Also, I found it haliraious that I couldn't remember inbuilt function syntax and also basic function decleration. What a dumbasssss ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

# Solutions

## Q1. Palindrome
- My thought process to sanitize the string .i.e remove all possible spaces and punctuations.
- Then use a 2 pointer check to check if palindrome.

### My Initial solution
```
function checkPalindrome(string $str){
    $str = strtoloer($str);
    $str = sanitizeString($str);

    $strLength = strlen($str);
    $firstPointer = 0;
    $lastPointer = $strLength - 1;
    $mid =  $strLength / 2;

    for($firstPointer=0; $firstPointer < $mid; $firstPointer++, $lastPointer--){
        if($str[$firstPointer] !== $str[$lastPointer]){
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

function sanitizeString(string $str){
    $filterableStrings = [" ", "?", ".", ......];
    $returnString  =  "";

    foreach($str as $char){
        if(in_array($char, $filterableStrings)){
            continue;
        }

        $returnString =  $returnString.$char;
    }
    
    return $returnString;
}

```

### My updated solution would be
- turn string to lowercase
- compare with ascii value to filter out chars
- make temp string, reverse it, and then compare it to original.

```
function checkPalindrome(string $str): bool {
    // Convert to lowercase
    $str = strtolower($str);
    $cleanStr = '';
    
    // ASCII values for a-z
    $minAscii = ord('a');
    $maxAscii = ord('z');
    
    // Build clean string with only a-z characters
    for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($str); $i++) {
        $charAscii = ord($str[$i]);
        if ($charAscii >= $minAscii && $charAscii <= $maxAscii) {
            $cleanStr .= $str[$i];
        }
    }
    
    // Check if clean string is a palindrome
    return $cleanStr === strrev($cleanStr);
}
```

## Q2. DigitSum
- This was pretty simple, I immediately knew that this was a case for recursion.

```
<?php

function digitSum(int $num){
    if(str_to_lenght((string)$num) === 1){
        return $num
    }

    $sum = 0;

    foreach($num as $char){
        $sum = $sum+$char;
    }

    return digitSum($sum);
}

```


## Q3. Bracket Sequence
- I knew I could solve this one, this is a Leetcode easy problem that I had solved in the past. But I didn't rememeber remember the flow. So I doodled some cases and realized that this< needed to be solved using stack. I could have solved this properly if I gave more time to this, but heres what I basically wrote.

### My Initial Solution
```
<?php

function checkSequenece(string $sequence): bool{
    $stack = [];
    $pairmap = [
        "{"=>"}",
        "}"=>"{",
        "("=>")",
        ")"=>"(",
        "["=>"]",
        "]"=>"["
    ];

    foreach($sequence as $bracket){
        if(canPush($bracket, $stack, $pairmap)){
            $stack[] = $bracket;
            continue;
        }

        $lastIndex = count($stack) - 1;

        if(canPop($bracket, $stack, $pairmap)){
            unset($stack[$lastIndex]);

            continue;
        }
    }
    
    return empty($stack);
}


function canPush($bracket, $stack, $pairmap){
    if(empty($stack)){
        return true;
    }

    if(in_array($bracket, $stack)){
        return false;
    }

    $lastIndex = count($stack) - 1;

    return $bracket ===  $pairmap[$stack[$lastIndex]];
}

function canPop($bracket, $stack, $pairmap){
    if(empty($stack)){
        return false;
    }
    
    $lastIndex = count($stack) - 1;

    return $bracket !==  $pairmap[$stack[$lastIndex]];
}

```

### My updated soultion would be:

```
var isValid = function(s) {
    const stack      = [];
    const bracketMap = {
        "}": "{",
        ")": "(",
        "]": "["
    }

   for(let i = 0 ; i<s.length; i++){
        const bracket = s[i];

        if(isOpeningBracket(bracket)){
            stack.push(bracket)
        }else if(hasRespOpeningBracketOnTop(stack, bracket)){
            stack.pop();
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }

    if(stack.length>0){
        return false
    }
    
    return true;

    function isOpeningBracket(bracket){
        return Object.values(bracketMap).includes(bracket);
    }

    function hasRespOpeningBracketOnTop(stack, bracket){
        return stack[stack.length-1] === bracketMap[bracket]
    }
};
``` 
## Q4. File path

- I didn't even try this because I did not understand the question.

>[!NOTE]
> For all sql queries I used CTEs because I personally like writing CTE's instead of subquery because of their readibility and usability. I basically wrote or tried writing these queries

WITH avg_salary AS (
    SELECT AVG(salary) AS overall_avg_salary
    FROM employees
)
SELECT overall_avg_salary
FROM avg_salary;

    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
    WHERE d.name = 'HR'

## Q7. Employees with Duplicate Email Addresses

```
WITH email_counts AS (
    SELECT email, COUNT(*) AS email_count
    FROM employees
    WHERE email IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

JOIN email_counts ec ON e.email = ec.email;
```


## Q8. Employees Earning More Than Their Department's Average Salary

```
WITH dept_avg AS (
    SELECT
